<p>A breadcrumb trail of post <a href="https://psadil.github.io/psadil/post/derivative-of-gaussian-for-serial-dependence/">topics</a> <a href="https://psadil.github.io/psadil/post/serial-dependence-reflects-a-preference-for-low-variability/">suggests</a> that I have been working on an experiment to explore <a href="https://psadil.github.io/psadil/post/serial-dependence/">serial dependence</a>. When I explain these kinds of experiments to people outside of cognitive psychology, I find it hard to explain the experiment’s simplicity. The tasks are basic.</p>
<p>Today, I am happy to report that I now have an online demonstration of the task! The demo can be reached <a href="https://morning-earth-15290.herokuapp.com/serialdependence">here</a>. The experiment will start with a few pages of (poorly formatted) instructions. After that, you’ll do 11 trials.</p>
