I am a post-doctoral researcher looking at the neural and cognitive mechanisms of visual perception and memory in the labs of [Drs. Rosemary Cowell](https://people.umass.edu/cmap-lab/People.html) and [David Huber](https://people.umass.edu/dehuber/). I'm also interested in developing statistical tools to allow better inferences in Psychology. During graduate school, my research involved [adapting a neural network for modeling cognition](https://psadil.github.io/psadil/publication/sadil-2017-computational/), investigating [associative learning and recollection for low-level visual information](https://psadil.github.io/psadil/publication/sadil-2019-connecting/), looking at [sequential effects in perceptual decisions](https://psadil.github.io/psadil/publication/sadil-2021-serialdependence/), and developing new ways to apply Bayesian inference to [behavioral](https://psadil.githubb.io/psadil/publication/sadil-2019-hierarchical/) or [neuroimaging](https://psadil.github.io/psadil/publication/sadil-2021-nmm/) data.
