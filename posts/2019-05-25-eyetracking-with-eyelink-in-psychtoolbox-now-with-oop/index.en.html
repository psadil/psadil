<p>I’ve started trying out <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/object-oriented-programming.html">MATLAB’s OOP</a> after mounting suspicion that the way I’d been coding experiments basically involved making something that looked and behaved like an object–but did so in a convoluted and inefficient way. See this <a href="https://psadil.github.io/psadil/post/eyetracking-init/">post on eyetracking with PTB</a> as proof.</p>
<p>This post is brief, and is about as well thought out as a github gist/gitlab snippet.</p>
<p>The two classes I’ll work with here is a Window class and a Tracker class. The window class has 3 methods. The first <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/class-constructor-methods.html">constructor</a> method exists just to create the object. The constructed object will have a few default properties of the class. The second method is open, which (can you guess?) calls the PTB functions to open an onscreen window. The open method is fancier than it needs to be for this post (note the PsychImaging configuration, and the optional debugLevel flag). The final window method is the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/handle-class-destructors.html">desctructor</a>. The destructor method is one of the advantages of leaning on MATLAB’s OOP syntax. That method will get called whenever the Window object’s lifecycle has ended (which might happen from explicit deletion of the object, closing MATLAB, the object is no longer referenced in the call stack, etc).</p>
<p>The second class is the Tracker class, which interfaces with Eyelink. The Window class is only present here because Eyelink needs an open window to run calibration. There are five Tracker methods, but they are either analogous to the Window objects methods (constructor, destructor) or were largely presented in the previous post.</p>

<p>The tracker object will mostly do what it did in the <a href="https://psadil.github.io/psadil/post/eyetracking-init/">previous post</a>. Same functionality, but the syntax is much cleaner than the heavy use of switch/case conditionals.</p>

<h2>Run the calibration (and use the tracker)</h2>
<p>Putting this together, the following script starts calibration, and outlines how this tracker could be used in an experiment.</p>
<pre class="matlab"><code>
%% input 
% ------------------

skipsynctests = 2;
debuglevel = 0;

%% setup
% ------------------

% initialize window
window = Window();

% open that window
open(window, skipsynctests, debuglevel)

% Initialize tracker object
tracker = Tracker(using_tracker, &#39;OOPDEMO.edf&#39;, window);

% run calibration
tracker.startup();

% Let Eyelink know that the experiment starts now
tracker.eyelink(&#39;message&#39;, &#39;SYNCTIME&#39;);

%% Experiment/trial code
% ------------------

% note that we should not need to wait to start recording,
% given that the stimulus will always be drawn a bit later
% (determined by how often phase changes occur)
tracker.eyelink(&#39;StartRecording&#39;);

% trial/experiment happens here ...

tracker.eyelink(&#39;StopRecording&#39;);
% Wait moment to ensure that tracker is definitely finished with the last few samples

%% Cleanup
% ------------------

% closes connection to Eyelink system, saves file
delete(tracker);

% closes window, restores keyboard input
delete(window);

<p>What’s nice about this syntax (as before) is that only very minimal changes are required you don’t want to call the Eyelink functions (e.g., if you’re testing on a computer that doesn’t have the Eyelink system connected, or you’re debugging other parts of the experiment). By changing just the input, the Eyelink functions won’t be called.</p>
