	abstract = {We review the Akaike, deviance, and Watanabe-Akaike information criteria from a Bayesian{\textbackslash}nperspective, where the goal is to estimate expected out-of-sample-prediction error using a biascorrected adjustment of within-sample error. We focus on the choices involved in setting up these{\textbackslash}nmeasures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The{\textbackslash}ncontribution of this paper is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive{\textbackslash}ncontext and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in{\textbackslash}npractice.},
