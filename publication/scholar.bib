  abstract = {Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions—behavioral control, declarative memory—have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process—a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event—is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of representational content (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.}

 title = {A hierarchical Bayesian state trace analysis for assessing monotonicity while factoring out subject, item, and trial level dependencies},
 year = {2019},
 abstract ={State trace analyses assess the latent dimensionality of a cognitive process by asking whether the means of two dependent variables conform to a monotonic function across a set of conditions. Using an assumption of independence between the measures, recently proposed statistical tests address bivariate measurement error, allowing both frequentist and Bayesian analyses of monotonicity (e.g., Davis-Stober, Morey, Gretton, & Heathcote, 2016; Kalish, Dunn, Burdakov, & Sysoev, 2016). However, statistical inference can be biased by unacknowledged dependencies between measures, particularly when the data are insufficient to overwhelm an incorrect prior assumption of independence. To address this limitation, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model that explicitly models the separate roles of subject, item, and trial-level dependencies between two measures. Assessment of monotonicity is then performed by fitting separate models that do or do not allow a non-monotonic relation between the condition effects (i.e., same versus different rank orders). The Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and Pseudo Bayesian Model Averaging – both cross validation measures of model fit – are used for model comparison, providing an inferential conclusion regarding the dimensionality of the latent psychological space. We validated this new state trace analysis technique using model recovery simulation studies, which assumed different ground truths regarding monotonicity and the direction/magnitude of the subject- and trial-level dependence. We also provide an example application of this new technique to a visual object learning study that compared performance on a visual retrieval task (forced choice part recognition) versus a verbal retrieval task (cued recall).}

  abstract = {Knowing the identity of an object can powerfully alter perception. Visual demonstrations of this—such as Gregory’s (1970) hidden Dalmatian—affirm the existence of both top-down and bottom-up processing. We consider a third processing pathway: lateral connections between the parts of an object. Lateral associations are assumed by theories of object processing and hierarchical theories of memory, but little evidence attests to them. If they exist, their effects should be observable even in the absence of object identity knowledge. We employed Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) while participants studied object images, such that visual details were learned without explicit object identification. At test, lateral associations were probed using a part-to-part matching task. We also tested whether part-whole links were facilitated by prior study using a part-naming task, and included another study condition (Word), in which participants saw only an object’s written name. The key question was whether CFS study (which provided visual information without identity) would better support part-to-part matching (via lateral associations) whereas Word study (which provided identity without the correct visual form) would better support part-naming (via top-down processing). The predicted dissociation was found and confirmed by state-trace analyses. Thus, lateral part-to-part associations were learned and retrieved independently of object identity representations. This establishes novel links between perception and memory, demonstrating that (a) lateral associations at lower levels of the object identification hierarchy exist and contribute to object processing and (b) these associations are learned via rapid, episodic-like mechanisms previously observed for the high-level, arbitrary relations comprising episodic memories. }

  abstract = {It is tempting to infer the behavior of individual neurons from the behavior of individual voxels in an fMRI experiment. For instance, voxel tuning functions (VTFs) measure the magnitude of the BOLD response to a range of stimulus features (e.g., orientation), producing results that resemble individual neural tuning functions (NTFs) from single-cell recordings – like a simple cell in V1, a voxel will prefer a particular orientation. However, a voxel likely reflects a mixture of different kinds of neurons with different preferred orientations. Taking a GLM approach to this problem, forward encoding models (e.g., Brouwer and Heeger, 2009, 2011) specify the strength of different neural sub-populations (e.g., neurons preferring different orientations) for each voxel. However, these models cannot identify changes in the shape of the neural tuning function because they assume a fixed NTF shape. For instance, these models could not identify whether the NTF sharpens with perceptual learning. To address this limitation, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model for inferring not only the relative proportions of neural sub-populations contributing to a voxel, but also the shape of the NTF and changes in NTF shape. To test the validity of this approach, we collected fMRI data while subjects viewed oriented gratings at low and high contrast. We considered three alternative forms of NTF modulation by stimulus contrast (additive shift, multiplicative gain, bandwidth sharpening). To the naked eye, the VTFs revealed an additive shift from low to high contrast. However, the hierarchical Bayesian model indicated that this shift was caused by multiplicative gain in the underlying NTFs, in line with single cell recordings. Beyond orientation, this approach could determine the form of neuromodulation in many fMRI experiments that test multiple points along a well-established dimension of variation (e.g., speed of motion, angle of motion, isoluminant hue).}

  abstract = {The hippocampus is considered pivotal to recall, allowing retrieval of information not available in the immediate environment. In contrast, neocortex is thought to signal familiarity, contributing to recall only when called upon by the hippocampus. However, this view is not compatible with representational accounts of memory, which reject the mapping of cognitive processes onto brain regions. According to representational accounts, the hippocampus is not engaged by recall per se, rather it is engaged whenever hippocampal representations are required. To test whether hippocampus is engaged by recall when hippocampal representations are not required, we used functional imaging and a non-associative recall task, with images (objects, scenes) studied in isolation, and image patches as cues. As predicted by a representational account, hippocampal activation was modulated by the content of the recalled memory, increasing during recall of scenes—which are known to be processed by hippocampus—but not during recall of objects. Object recall instead engaged neocortical regions known to be involved in object-processing. Further supporting the representational account, effective connectivity analyses revealed that changes in functional activation during recall were driven by increased information flow from neocortical sites, rather than by the spreading of recall-related activation from hippocampus back to neocortex.},
